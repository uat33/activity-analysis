# activity-analysis


This is a program to analyze exercise info that I made as a school assignment a while back. 

Use by running the ActivityDriver file. If you want to add your own files to analyze, currently they will have to be called YEAR.txt where year is what you'll enter onto the prompt. 

The sample files currently on the repository were provided by a teacher. I believe the files follow a format that's actually used by a smartwatch company and are real data taken from there.
